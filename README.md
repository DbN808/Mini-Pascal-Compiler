## **This is a compiler for Mini PASCAL language made using Lex and Yacc**
---
##### **This compiler is based on the following 5 tasks:**
+ **Lexical Analysis** - Lex code breaks the input program into tokens(identifiers, operators, numbers, keywords, punctuators,etc).
+ **Syntax Analysis** - Yacc code takes the tokens generated after Lexical Analysis and checks if the given program is syntactically correct or not.
+ **Semantic Analysis** - Here we check for semantic errors(like type checking, undeclared variables, multiple declarations, etc) and we print the Abstract Syntax Tree generated.
+ **Intermediate Code Generation** - We generate the intermediate code for the program in three address code format.
+ **Output** - Here we extend our Yacc program to print out the output of the given input program.


**The Language Specifications for Mini PASCAL are given in the LangSpecs pdf**
